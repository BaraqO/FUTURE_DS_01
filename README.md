The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
I have built a predictive model that answers the question, " What sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (e.g., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

## Data Understanding
### Dataset Overview
Rows: 891 (Individual cases)
Columns: 12(Variables for survival prediction)

## Dataset Variables
The following is the key to the data:
  
  a) survival- Survival:	0 = No, 1 = Yes
  
  b) pclass- Ticket class:	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
  
  c) sex- Sex: Male or Female	
  
  d) Age- Age in years	
  
  e) sibsp- Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
  
  f) parch- Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
  
  g) ticket- Ticket number	
  
  h) fare- Passenger fare	
  
  I) cabin- Cabin number	
  
  j) embarked- Port of Embarkation:	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
